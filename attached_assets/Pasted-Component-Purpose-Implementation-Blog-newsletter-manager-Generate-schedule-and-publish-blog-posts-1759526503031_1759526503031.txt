Newsletter builder can create monthly emails summarizing blog posts, promotions and project updates.  Include personalization tokens and segmentation based on lead status.  Connect to email service providers (Mailchimp, SendGrid) via API.

Create workflows triggered by lead status changes.  For example, send an introductory email when a lead is captured, a value‑based email after an estimate is sent, and a reminder if no response is received.  Integrate SMS for urgent scheduling (e.g., emergency repair leads).
Personalized content & segmentation
Delivering relevant information based on lead type improves engagement .
Use lead data (project type, urgency, interests) to tailor blog suggestions, newsletters and follow‑ups.  The content engine can automatically insert relevant case studies or testimonials into emails.
