Summary of the client and existing site
	•	Company – T&B Dock is a waterfront construction firm based in Coeur D’Alene, Idaho.  The company builds new docks, performs full dock rebuilds and repairs, installs tarps and ramps and offers accessories ￼.  The site emphasises a local focus (“Your Local Waterfront Construction Company”) and invites visitors to schedule a free estimate ￼.  An About Us section explains that owner Tyler Hinton started the company out of love for the lake and craftsmanship ￼.
	•	Design & tone – The homepage uses a hero image of a dock on a lake with an overlaid dark navy bar and gold logo.  Headings are bold white text on dark backgrounds, giving a clean, modern feel.  Sections are separated with large photographs and short, confident copy.  Service descriptions are brief, focusing on “new docks,” “full rebuilds” and “repairs & accessories” with calls to contact for more information ￼.  Testimonials are displayed in simple quote blocks ￼.  The blog has a dark background and simple card‑style layout for posts.
	•	Current content operations – The blog contains three posts published in May 2024 (“Creating the Perfect Lakefront Oasis,” “Maximizing Your Waterfront Property Value” and “The Importance of Proper Dock Maintenance”) and a newsletter signup form ￼.  There is no clear social‑media or automated lead‑capture funnel, and the contact page only provides a basic form and opening hours ￼.  This indicates the company is relying on manual lead handling and needs a system to capture, qualify and nurture prospects.

Industry‑specific considerations
	•	Lead types and long sales cycles – In construction and marine services, a “lead” is more than just contact information.  It represents a prospective client at various stages of the customer journey; some leads are ready to start within weeks, others are still gathering information, and there are also “emergency” leads requiring rapid response (e.g., storm damage repairs) ￼.  Lead cycles in construction involve longer timelines and multiple decision‑makers such as property owners, architects, subcontractors and government agencies ￼.  Large project values mean that reputation and credibility matter more than price ￼.
	•	Importance of a CRM for construction – Firms using specialized construction CRM systems report faster bid response times, better customer satisfaction and more consistent project handovers ￼.  CRM analytics help teams discover which referral sources drive the most profitable projects ￼, analyze project‑delay patterns and generate more accurate estimates ￼.  Warranty and maintenance tracking can cut response times to post‑project issues by half, turning issues into repeat business ￼.  Construction CRM software must be project‑centric, coordinating multiple stakeholders and tracking relationships across phases from initial bid through handover ￼.
	•	Key CRM features for construction – Essential capabilities include:
	•	Project management features such as automated bid tracking, change‑order management, requests‑for‑information (RFI) tracking, milestone notifications and resource allocation ￼.
	•	Document control with digital drawing management, permit & certification tracking, version control, automated routing and mobile access ￼.
	•	Field operations support, including real‑time progress updates from job sites, photo/video documentation, daily logs, material tracking and offline capability ￼.
	•	Team communication via centralized messaging, automated status updates, task assignments and client portals ￼.
	•	Contact management with multiple contacts per project, shared address books, permission‑based access and real‑time synchronization ￼.  Keeping contact lists accurate across field and office teams is critical ￼.
	•	Marketing automation – Modern marketing tools for construction emphasize personalized content delivery, automated lead scoring and conversational marketing via AI‑driven chatbots ￼.  Marketing automation platforms should integrate with the CRM to align sales and marketing, handle email campaigns, social‑media scheduling, lead scoring and follow‑ups ￼.  This ensures leads are captured from websites and social channels, scored based on engagement and assigned to the appropriate sales rep ￼.
	•	Sandler sales methodology – The Sandler approach emphasizes creating a win‑win scenario by asking the right questions, actively listening, and addressing prospects’ pain points honestly and transparently ￼.  Core principles include building strong relationships, qualifying prospects and uncovering hidden pain points ￼.  The method follows steps such as bonding and rapport building, establishing upfront contracts, identifying pain, discussing budget and decision‑making process, and fulfilling and post‑sell protocols ￼.  Effective appointment‑setting scripts should convey the company’s personality, help qualify leads and collect information for the sales team.  Appointment calls often require multiple dials—Gartner estimates an average of 18 calls are needed to connect with a buyer, so automation and follow‑up reminders are essential.

Proposed AI‑enabled platform
